# DTC
A tool that shows a lot of information about a site but most importantly shows the nearest avaialble tech
<br>
The Distance-Time Calculator (DTC) is one of the primary tools of our department. It is used to find lots of basic information about a site but most importantly is used to determine the nearest available technician to a site for the purpose of assigning trouble tickets.
<br><br>
In the primary tab, sites can be searched by either their 4 or 6 digit site number or by their gateway IP addess (e.g. 7193, 4697, 100150 or 172.26.176.1 or 10.23.34.1). Relevant data is returned from multiple tables on three different servers. Data includes type of site, address, phone and fax numbers, clinic operating hours, Gateway IP, clinic manager, number of dialysis stations, type and network address of the Helmer medication refridgerator, default printer, organizational group (OG) and nearest techs in that OG, plus BioMed(BMT) and Area Technical Operations Manager (ATOM).

The nearest tech info box is color coded: Green for In, Red for Out, Yellow for In but Unavailable
<br><br>
Not all information is available for all sites. On one of the most important aspects, the organizational group (OG), if no information is available, it makes a guess based on other nearby sites. This make sit easier to assign a local tech.

Some fields have interactions:
<ul>
  <li>Clicking on any address field copies the address to the clipboard and double-clicking any address field brings up a Google map of the site's area in Google Maps in a browser window.</li>
  <li>Clicking a BioMed or ATOM copies their email to the clipboard.</li>
  <li>Double-clicking the PM Results Hours datebox brings up a pop-up window with all past site survey hours for the clinic.</li>
  <li>Double-clicking any printer field brings up a window with all known printers at the site.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
The Zip Code Search tab allows you to enter a Zip Code and find the nearest sites and techs. Techs are color coded the same as in the tech info box on the main tab. Site are color coded: green for Active sites, yellow for Inactive sites, red for Closed or Sold sites and light blue for planned sites.
